# force-gb-mode
ROM to launch games on GBA/GBC/GB Player/SGB/SGB2 in forced GB mode.

## GBA/GBC
You can launch this from a flashcart to force GB mode on your GBA/GBC.
You can select the palette the loaded game will use during this ROM's booting
by using the GBC palette-changing key combinations.

After that, you will need to (sometimes EXTREMELY) slowly remove your cartridge and insert a new one
once this ROM is running.
Finally, press A to start the game.

Beware of the left pin, which may cause a reset. It may be useful to repeat the process various
times while slowly extracting the cartridge on certain flashcarts.

## SGB/SGB2
You can launch this from a flashcart to force GB mode on your SGB.

After that, you will need to remove your cartridge and insert a new one.
It doesn't matter if the Nintendo logo appears.
