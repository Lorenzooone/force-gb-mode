# force-gb-mode
ROM to launch games on GBA/GBC/GB Player in forced GB mode.

You can launch this from a flashcart to force GB mode on your GBA/GBC.
You can select the palette the loaded game will use during this ROM's booting
by using the GBC palette-changing key combinations.

After that, you will need to (sometimes EXTREMELY) slowly remove your cartridge and insert a new one
after launching this ROM.
Finally, press A to start the game.

Beware of the left pin, which may cause a reset. It may be useful to repeat the process various
times while slowly lifting up the cartridge on certain flashcarts.
